**WARNING WILL NOT WORK IN G++**

For our group project we created a GUI based application designed to assist roomate communication. The main idea is that roommates will be able to communicate and notify each other of their activity status. This is done by updating a setting from the following options: home, away, coming home, and sleeping. The menu interface will change in color for each corresponding setting. This is done by entering individual letters in your keyboard. As of now our GUI based program is a stand-alone version that demonstrates the capabilites without network capabilites and without multiple users. However, additional members will change their activity status automatically (approximately every 20 seconds) to simulate multiple users.
**change when fully finished**
Upon startup the user inputs a group name and a group is created. The user is then assigned the role of admin, meaning that the user has the capabilites to remove a member from the group. A menu screen is then printed to the screen and the user is asked what they want to do. There are seven menu options and inputing the respective number will execute the command. The first option is "Change Status" where the user can change their status to home, away, coming home, or sleeping. The second option is "Add Member" this allows the user to add new members to the group and give a name to this new user. The third option is "Remove Member" and this allows the user to remove a member from the group, the user must input the name of the member to be removed. The fourth option is "Change Group Privacy" and allows the user the change the status of the group from public to private. The fifth option is "Set Your Description" this allows the user to inform other members of the group important information. The sixth option is "View Members" and when called the application prints a list of current members in the group and their respective statuses. The final option, option seven is called "Exit", when called the program closes.

To compile the program, make sure all the header files are in the same directory and compile the main .cpp file.
